## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User starts the quiz on the `MainActivity`.
2. Each question can be answered with **True** or **False** buttons.
3. User can click the **Cheat** button to reveal the answer.
4. If the user cheats, this is recorded in a `boolean[] mIsCheater`.
5. When the user answers a question:
   - If they cheated, a **judgment toast** appears.
   - If not, a **correct/incorrect** toast is shown.
6. At the end of the quiz, the app hides the buttons and displays the score.
